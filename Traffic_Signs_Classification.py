Traffic Signs Classification Project - LeNet Deep Network

This project utilizes the LeNet deep network architecture to classify 42 different 
types of traffic signs. LeNet refers to a convolutional neural network that can be 
used for computer vision and classification models. This project showcases a 
step-by-step implementation of the model as well as in-depth notes to customize the 
model further for higher accuracy.

We will first start by importing the necessary libraries we will need:
"""
# Classic libraries that will help us read and analyze data
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Libraries used for plotting and data visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Using pickle package to open our data, not much use after that
import pickle


"""
Importing the data into three different sections: training, validation, and
testing. Training data is used to train the network, testing data is used to test
the trained network with data that it has never seen to see how it would perform in
the real world. The validation dataset ensures that we avoid overfitting by showing
the network validation data every epoch (or run) in a process called 
cross-validation to ensure that the network is not focusing on the details of the
training data. 
"""
with open("./traffic-signs-data/train.p", mode = 'rb') as training_data:
  train = pickle.load(training_data) # Use pickle's load method to load the defined data as the variable test

with open("./traffic-signs-data/valid.p", mode = 'rb') as validation_data:
  valid = pickle.load(validation_data)

with open("./traffic-signs-data/test.p", mode = 'rb') as testing_data:
  test = pickle.load(testing_data)
